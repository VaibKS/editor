# enCode Code Editor

This is a simple code editor I made to test my JavaScript skills a few years back.

To use, just visit [vaibks.github.io/editor](https://vaibks.github.io/editor).

The code is minified, hence it isn't that readable.
I lost the main version due to hard disk failure, this was the hosted, minified version I was left with.
